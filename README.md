Learn how to make a native Clojure CLI!

This is a tutorial and quickstart to GraalVM-based Clojure CLIs that require a bit of dynamic evaluation.

The tutorial is set up around an example CLI that reads JSON from stdin and
transforms it using a function which is dynamically evaluated.

## Prerequisites

- Download [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/). Just download it to
  your Downloads folder and unzip the archive. No further installation
  required. This tutorial is based on version 21.1.0 JDK11.

- Set the `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable. E.g.:

  `export GRAALVM_HOME=/Users/borkdude/Downloads/graalvm-ce-java11-21.1.0/Contents/Home`

- To run the Clojure CLI with Clojure or Java, you will need to have a
  Java 8 or 11 installation available. You can also use the downloaded GraalVM for this.

- Install [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka#installation) (0.4.1 or higher).

### Windows

Always use `cmd.exe` for executing GraalVM compilation, do not use PowerShell.

On Windows, install Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 and in `cmd.exe` load:

```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
```

This will set the right environment variables for GraalVM.

After this you should be able to run `bb native-image`.

## Tasks
